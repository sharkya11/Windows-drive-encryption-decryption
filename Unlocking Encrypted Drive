Removing BitLocker encryption from a drive involves decrypting the entire drive, which can be a time-consuming process depending on the size of the drive and the speed of your computer. Here are the general steps to remove BitLocker encryption from a drive in Windows:

### Using Windows Control Panel

1. **Open Control Panel**: Press the Windows key, type "Control Panel," and press Enter.

2. **Go to System and Security**: Click on "System and Security."

3. **Access BitLocker Drive Encryption**: Find and click on "BitLocker Drive Encryption."

4. **Choose the Drive**: Locate the drive that is currently encrypted with BitLocker and click on it.

5. **Turn Off BitLocker**: Find the option to "Turn Off BitLocker" or "Decrypt the drive." You will be prompted to confirm your choice.

6. **Wait for the Decryption Process**: The decryption process will start. This could take a significant amount of time, depending on the size of the drive and the speed of your computer. You can monitor the progress in the BitLocker Drive Encryption menu.

### Using Windows PowerShell

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**: Press the Windows key, type "PowerShell," right-click on Windows PowerShell in the search results, and select "Run as administrator."

2. **Use the Disable-BitLocker Cmdlet**: Type the following command to decrypt the drive, replacing `X:` with the letter of the drive you wish to decrypt:

   ```powershell
   Disable-BitLocker -MountPoint "X:"
   ```

3. **Wait for the Decryption to Complete**: Like with the Control Panel method, this process can take some time. You can check the status of the decryption by looking at the drive in File Explorer; the BitLocker lock icon will disappear once decryption is complete.

### Before You Start

- **Backup Your Data**: It's a good idea to back up your data before starting the decryption process, just in case something goes wrong.

- **Ensure Power Stability**: If you're decrypting a laptop, make sure it's plugged into a power source to prevent the process from being interrupted by a low battery.

- **Time**: Remember, decryption can take a long time, especially for large drives. Plan accordingly.

After decryption, the drive will no longer be protected by BitLocker, and its contents will be accessible without any additional encryption overhead or need for a PIN or recovery key at startup.
